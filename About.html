        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, My name is Mahammad or Mo for short. 
            I love to design, to make people happy with something I have created is something I strive for.
            I'm from Chorley however love to travel around Lancashire, Liverpool and Manchester.

            I've always had a passion about designing, It is something I've done since highschool.
            During highschool I did a lot of Photography, as a subject and a passion and from this I fell in love
            with designing through the use of Photoshop.

            As I continued my studies, I wanted to further develop my designing skills and I knew that having some
            compting knowledge would further enhance my skills and understanding.
            I had always known about illustrator and how it could enhance designing projects, for this reason after
            gaining some computing knowledge throughout college, I decided to pick it up.
            I was afraid at first, but the confidence I gained through studies and hard work helped overcome this.

            When it came to choosing a course at University, there where many options I could take within Design.
            Web Design was something I was interested in, as I enjoyed the projects done in College and it is something
            which could make use of many different designing applications and programs.
            I wanted to learn more about these, and decided to study Web Design & Developement.
            I learned many new skills, such as being able to understand the user, 
            their design queries as well as how to prototype.
            I also learned many different coding skills focusing mainly on HTML, CSS and Javescript.
