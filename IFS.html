        <p class="ShadesP">
            This project is about finding a local business website and then completely changing and redesigning how it looks. 
            The goal is to modernise and include better features than currently on the website, so it can better do the tasks it was made to do.

        <h1 class="contentH">Choosing the Website</h1>
        <p class="contentP">
            This website was selected because it is very outdated compared to other websites within the local area. 
            At first glance, it is easy to tell that the website is very old and was something which was created a long time ago, 
            the site still uses tables which is something which is avoided by most designers, for this reason this website seems like the perfect candidate to redesign for. 
            New designs will make use of Grid CSS, to modernise the website not only will this make the website more appealing, 
            but it also allows the website to compete with other modern websites. Other than the website being made using tables, 
            there are also many other problems which could be fixed throughout the whole website, there seems to be some sort of problem which can be fixed and improved on every single page throughout the website. 
            If IFS have other competitors they would ultimately lose if their competitors put a higher budget on their website and used modern techniques, 
            the goal of this project is to bring IFS Limited up to par with modern websites so they can compete.

            This is a mood board created for the website. The use of purple, green and white would stay consistent throughout the website as they are the colours of the logo, and the business brand in general. They aren’t exactly the right shade of colours used within the logo, however the lighter colours chosen would look better throughout the website. The background is also a very light tint of green followed by a more adamant green for other shapes and texts.  
            The banners and images above are from the original website and can be reused within the redesign, however underneath are better high quality images which could be used instead.  At the top are two different fonts which could be used all throughout the website, These fonts would look better on the website that the one currently used on their old site. Some logos have also been created for the contact page, this is because the website seems adamant about getting customers to contact them, and if there are some eye catching logo’s, this would increase the chances of users actually contacting the business.

            To conclude, the website had been completely redesigned and modernized compared to the original website, which was using Tables, the new one which has been created through this project uses Grid CSS which is something that is used in most modern websites. The new website looks modernized and immediately catches the eyes of new users who would like to visit the site. Unlike the old website where everything is plain, and there’s too much text and repetition. The new website reduces the amount of time text by only having it where it’s needed, such as the contact information, it is only within the contact page or other pages if it’s necessary. The huge amounts of text have also been reduced so users don’t get overwhelmed. Users are much more likely to use and stay on the website created during this project rather than the older one which is currently live as the problems it had have been solved.        </p>
